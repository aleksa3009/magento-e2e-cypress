# Daily Report - Day 4

## Date
20-09-2025

## Completed Tasks
- Implemented **Cart & Checkout flows** end-to-end (Day 4):
  - Created deterministic fixtures:
    - `cypress/fixtures/cart.json` (Gray Hoodie, Blue Baseball Cap)
    - `cypress/fixtures/checkout-user.json`
    - reused `cart-empty.json` and `cart-after-add.json` for stubbed scenarios
  - Added spec files:
    - `cypress/e2e/cart.cy.js` — UI + stubbed add/remove, badge count, qty update
    - `cypress/e2e/checkout.cy.js` — Guest checkout up to payment screen (Faker used)
    - `cypress/e2e/checkout-registered.cy.js` — Registered user checkout (prefilled shipping assertions)
    - `cypress/e2e/checkout-negative.cy.js` — Negative/edge cases (invalid postcode, empty cart, remove item updates total)
  - Integrated **Faker (@faker-js/faker)** in guest checkout to generate dynamic shipping data.
  - Updated Cypress configuration:
    - `cypress.config.js` updated to include `cypress/e2e/**/*.cy.{js,ts}` pattern
    - Added `cypress-mochawesome-reporter` configuration and reporterOptions
    - Kept timeouts, retries, video/screenshot and code-coverage task
  - CI / GitHub Actions:
    - Added/updated workflow to run Day 4 specs and produce artifacts
    - Workflow merges Mochawesome JSON reports and generates HTML
    - Uploads artifacts: `cypress/videos`, `cypress/screenshots`, `reports/mochawesome/html`
  - Tests committed on feature branch `feature/cart-checkout-day4`, merged into `main` and pushed to remote (fast-forward merge completed).
  - Added screenshots in tests (screenshot commands present to capture key steps).

### Artifacts produced
- Screenshots: `cypress/screenshots/...`
- Videos: `cypress/videos/...`
- Mochawesome HTML report: `reports/mochawesome/html/report.html` (generated by CI step)

## Issues Faced
- Demo site instability and changing selectors — tests use fixtures and stubbing to remain deterministic.
- Flaky locators in mini-cart overlay (noted; selectors may need further hardening).
- Some assertions are “demo-friendly” / dummy because live demo state can change (this is documented).
- CI/Mochawesome: ensure reporter JSON path matches `reporterOptions` to avoid empty merges.

## Next Steps
- **Day 5 focus**:
  - Accessibility testing using `cypress-axe`.
  - Responsive layout checks for mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports.
  - Performance measurements (page load times, rendering speed, interactive elements).
  - Capture screenshots/videos of any accessibility or layout issues.
  - Document findings in **TestExecutionReport.md** for Day 5.

## Notes
- Day 4 focused on **Cart & Checkout**: comprehensive coverage (UI flows, stubbed network flows, guest & registered checkout, negative scenarios).
- Tests are structured to demonstrate Cypress best practices (fixtures, `cy.intercept`, custom commands, dynamic data).
- All implementation is pushed to `main`; documentation (TestExecutionReport.md) still to commit — will add to `main` next.
