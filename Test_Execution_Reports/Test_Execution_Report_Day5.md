- `cypress/integration/performance.cy.js` — Performance tests (Cypress Audit / Lighthouse)
- Previous Day 1–4 tests verified for stability

## Environment

- Browser: Chrome (Lighthouse), Electron locally
- Viewport: 1280x800

## Execution Summary

## Test Details

### Accessibility
- Homepage, Cart, Checkout pages: **0 violations**

### Performance
- Lighthouse thresholds met:
  - Performance ≥50, Accessibility ≥70, SEO ≥70
- Metrics captured: TTI, FCP, Speed Index

### Stability Verification
- All previous tests (Auth, Search, Cart, Checkout) passed after refactor
- Conditional waits replaced static `cy.wait()`, improving reliability

## Issues
- Minor npm warnings (no functional impact)
- Lighthouse metrics vary slightly by environment (within threshold)

## Artifacts
- Screenshots: `cypress/screenshots/...`

- HTML report: `reports/mochawesome/html/report.html`

## Next Steps
- Review accessibility/performance findings
- Integrate improvements if needed

## Conclusion
Day 5 focused on **Accessibility, Performance, and Stabilization**.  
All new tests passed, previous tests stabilized, and CI now fully reports artifacts.
