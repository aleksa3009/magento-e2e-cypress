## Test Details

### Authentication Tests (`auth.cy.js`)

### Dynamic Registration Test (`register.cy.js`)
1. **Register a new user and logout**
   - Status: Passed
   - Notes: Faker used for unique email. User registered successfully and logged out.

## Issues Encountered
- Initial selector challenges for login button and dropdown menu.
- Temporary `cy.wait()` used to stabilize UI.
- Demo site prevents reusing previously registered emails.
- Newly created accounts expire after a short period.

## Artifacts
- Screenshots folder contains captures of any failures (none today).
- Videos folder contains full run recording.
- Mochawesome HTML report generated in `reports/mochawesome/html/report.html`.

## Next Steps
- Refactor fragile selectors for stability.
- Add more tests: Account Creation, Search & Filtering, Cart, Checkout.
- Replace static waits with conditional waits (`cy.intercept` or `cy.get().should()`).
- Integrate CI fully with caching, matrix testing, and artifact uploads.
- Add accessibility (axe) and performance tests in future days.
